# Project Euler Notes


## Problem 14
This problem was the toughest so far. A potential solution wasn't that
difficult when the numbers were small. Once I started searching the
Collatz numbers up to 1,000,000 though, I started getting "Out of
Memory" errors and the time taken went up dramatically. I found
a write-up for the solution on a blog that used a loop to keep track
of the longest Collatz sequence rather than generating all of the
sequences and then finding the longest. So I did that and it worked
like a charm. 

Took from 28 to 35 seconds on the MacBook Air.
